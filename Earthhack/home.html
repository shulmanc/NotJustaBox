    <h2>Our Mission:</h2>

    <p>As the world grapples with the unprecedented implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is the time for all of us to come together and make a change. We must focus on the workers and volunteers who have the world on their shoulders and could use a little help. With the power of Smurfit Kappaâ€™s corrugated products, we can provide these heroes with supplies they need to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 Virus. Grocery store's cardboard boxes can be weak and can have pests or unwanted bugs and germs. The volunteers and companies delivering to the elderly in isolation need something they can count on, they need something that is not just a box, but a support system, and we have got you covered.</p>

    <p>Helping the enviornment:</p>
    <p>Every year the world dumps a massive 2.12 billion tons of waste. A lot of that waste includes the packaging for millions of products. We have come so far in the fight against plastic waste, and a pandemic should not be the reason we throw all our progress away. Non-recycled plastic waste ends up in landfills, out oceans and water ways, and the environment with biodegrading. Slowly overtime plastics break down into microplastics, which can affect the balance of ecosystems and wildlife. We have and can continue to change our fate by slowly deterring from single use plastic waste. We want to continue to focus on a much more environmentally friendly option. With the power of Smurfit Kappa, we would like to substitute out the plastic bags used by all stores and replace them with 100% renewable corrugated products. We want to improve the environmentally footprint of all customers, while also providing a stronger substitute then single use plastic.</p>

    <p>This map displays who we are trying to target our resources to. We want these neighborhoods to have all essential corrugated materials because the people in these neighborhoods are not shopping but are being saved by heroes who are helping others in need. We want to supply the volunteers with resources that are environmentally friendly, are safer against the virus, and are stronger and sturdier than the average plastic bag.</p>
    <p>Corrugated boxes are more sustainable, sturdy, and spacious then plastic bags, and can be made readily available for the people in need.</p>

    </br>Census tracts:

    </br>360

    <p>A Census Tract is an area roughly equivalent to a neighborhood established by the Bureau of Census for analyzing populations. They generally encompass a population between 2,500 to 8,000 people.</p>
