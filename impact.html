    <h3>Global Effect:</h3>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has gone in the wrong direction in terms of climate action. We as a nation have taken a stand against single use plastic and should continue to hold this stance no matter what is thrown at us. These two states specifically have taken the great step of banning single use plastics and we will help them to continue this environmental campaign.</p>

    <p>Jim Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores, told CNN on Friday that there has been a lot of confusion and anxiety about the ban from members.</p>
    <p>"The biggest problem right now is the shortage and rising cost of the paper bags that were supposed to be the inexpensive alternative to plastic for consumers who neglect to bring their own reusable bag," said Calvin.</p>

    <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 remains for several hours to days on surfaces and in aerosols, a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found.</p>
    <p>The study suggests that people may acquire the coronavirus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. Scientists discovered the virus is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.</p>

    <p>This map displays who we are trying to target our resources to. We want these neighborhoods to have all essential corrugated materials because the people in these neighborhoods are not shopping but are being saved by heroes who are helping others in need. We want to supply the volunteers with resources that are environmentally friendly, are safer against the virus, and are stronger and sturdier than the average plastic bag.</p>
    <p>Corrugated boxes are more sustainable, sturdy, and spacious then plastic bags, and can be made readily available for the people in need.</p>
    <p>Places with a median age over 60 will be the first areas that need our assistance. These locations are indicated by the dark blue areas on the map.</p>
